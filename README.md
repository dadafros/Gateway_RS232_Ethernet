# Gateway_RS232_Ethernet
This is my final project at Federal University of Minas Gerais developed to obtain my graduation title as Control and Automation Engineer. 

This project is executed in a Arduino MEGA.
The Arduino works as a gateway translating commands from a SCADA (OPC protocol through ethenet) to a serial device (RS232 protocol) and vice-versa.

The projec uses a Arduino IDE for Visual Studio (Visual Micro).
The project uses a OPC library from Ildefonso Martinez (available in Arduino Platform).
The serial device is a MAXON EPOS 70/10 controller for position and velocity control of a DC motor.
